## 2025-05-15 - [CRITICAL] Path Traversal in Proxy Handler Bypass RBAC
**Vulnerability:** The `HandleProxy` function used `url.JoinPath` with user-controlled `name` and `namespace` parameters without validation. This allowed attackers to traverse up the URL path (e.g., `../services/myservice`) and access resources they didn't have RBAC permissions for (e.g., checking permission for `pods` but accessing `services`).
**Learning:** `url.JoinPath` resolves `..` elements. When constructing URLs for backend requests based on user input, validating that the input doesn't contain path traversal sequences is critical, especially when RBAC checks are performed on the input parameters before URL construction.
**Prevention:** Strictly validate all URL parameters used in backend requests. Ensure `name` and `namespace` do not contain `/` or `..`. Reject `path` parameters that contain `..`.
